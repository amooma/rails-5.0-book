== Introduction

I have been programming for 35 years and most of the time I have managed
quite well without test-driven development (TDD). I am not going to be
mad at you if you decide to just skip this chapter. You can
create Rails applications without tests and are not likely to get any
bad karma as a result (at least, I hope not - but you can never be
entirely sure with the whole karma thing).

But if you should decide to go for TDD, then I can promise you that it
is an enlightenment. The basic idea of TDD is that you write a test for
each programming function to check this function. In the pure TDD
teaching, this test is written before the actual programming. Yes, you
will have a lot more to do initially. But later, you can run all the
tests and see that the application works exactly as you wanted it to.
The read advantage only becomes apparent after a few weeks or months,
when you look at the project again and write an extension or new
variation. Then you can safely change the code and check it still works
properly by running the tests. This avoids a situation where you find
yourself saying "oops, that went a bit wrong, I just didn’t think of
this particular problem".

Often, the advantage of TDD already becomes evident when writing a
program. Tests can reveal many careless mistakes that you would
otherwise only have stumbled across much later on.

This chapter is a brief overview of the topic test-driven development
with Rails. If you have tasted blood and want to find out more, you can
dive into the official Rails documentation at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html.

NOTE: TDD is just like driving a car. The only way to learn it is by doing it.

[[example-for-a-user-in-a-web-shop]]
== Example for a User in a Web Shop

Let’s start with a user scaffold in an imaginary web shop:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails new webshop**
  [...]
$ **cd webshop**
$ **rails generate scaffold user login_name first_name last_name birthday:date**
      [...]
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/user_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/users.yml
      [...]
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/users_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      [...]
$ **rake db:migrate**
      [...]
----

You already know all about scaffolds (if not, please go and read the chapter
xref:scaffolding-and-rest["Scaffolding and REST"] first)
so you know what the application we have just created does. The scaffold
created a few tests (they are easy to recognise because the word `test`
is in the file name).

The complete test suite of a Rails project is processed with the command
`rails test`. Let’s have a go and see what a test produces at this stage
of development:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48169
Run options: --seed 30780

# Running:

.......

Finished in 2.128604s, 3.2885 runs/s, 5.6375 assertions/s.

7 runs, 12 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

The output `7 runs, 12 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips` looks
good. By default, a test will run correctly in a standard scaffold.

Let’s now edit the `app/models/user.rb` and insert a few validations (if
these are not entirely clear to you, please read the section
xref:validation["Validation"]):

[source,ruby]
.app/models/user.rb
----
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :login_name,
            presence: true,
            length: { minimum: 10 }

  validates :last_name,
            presence: true
end
----

Then we execute `rails test` again:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48284
Run options: --seed 61281

# Running:

"User.count" didn't change by 1.
Expected: 3
  Actual: 2

bin/rails test test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb:19

.....

Finished in 0.305897s, 22.8835 runs/s, 32.6908 assertions/s.

7 runs, 10 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

Boom! This time we have `1 failures`. The error happens in the
`should create user` and the `should update user`. The
explanation for this is in our validation. The example data created by
the scaffold generator went through in the first `rails test` (without
validation). The errors only occurred the second time (with validation).

This example data is created as _fixtures_tests tests
in YAML format in the directory `test/fixtures/`. Let’s have a look at
the example data for `User` in the file `test/fixtures/users.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/users.yml
----
one:
  login_name: MyString
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  birthday: 2015-12-27

two:
  login_name: MyString
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  birthday: 2015-12-27
----

There are two example records there that do not fulfill the requirements
of our validation. The `login_name` should have a length of at least 10.
Let’s change the `login_name` in `test/fixtures/users.yml` accordingly:

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/users.yml
----
one:
  login_name: MyString12
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  birthday: 2015-12-27

two:
  login_name: MyString12
  first_name: MyString
  last_name: MyString
  birthday: 2015-12-27
----

Now, a `rails test` completes without any errors again:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48169
Run options: --seed 3341

# Running:

.......

Finished in 0.326051s, 21.4690 runs/s, 39.8711 assertions/s.

7 runs, 12 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

Now we know that valid data has to be contained in the
`test/fixtures/users.yml` so that the standard test created via scaffold
will succeed. But nothing more. Next step is to change the
`test/fixtures/users.yml` to a minimum (for example, we do not need a
`first_name`):

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/users.yml
----
one:
  login_name: MyString12
  last_name: Mulder

two:
  login_name: MyString12
  last_name: Scully
----

To be on the safe side, let’s do another `rake test` after making
our changes (you really can’t do that often enough):

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test**

# Running:

.......

Finished in 0.336391s, 20.8091 runs/s, 38.6455 assertions/s.

7 runs, 12 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

IMPORTANT: All fixtures are loaded into the database when a test is
           started. You need to keep this in mind for your test,
           especially if you use `uniqueness` in your validation.

[[functional-tests]]
=== Functional Tests

Let’s take a closer look at the point where the original errors
occurred:

[subs=+quotes]
----
"User.count" didn't change by 1.
Expected: 3
  Actual: 2

bin/rails test test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb:19
----

In the `UsersControllerTest` the User could not be created.
The controller tests are located in the directory `test/functional/`.
Let’s now take a good look at the file
`test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb`

[source,ruby]
.test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb
----
require 'test_helper'

class UsersControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup do
    @user = users(:one)
  end

  test "should get index" do
    get users_url
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should get new" do
    get new_user_url
    assert_response :success
  end

  test "should create user" do
    assert_difference('User.count') do
      post users_url, params: { user: { birthday: @user.birthday, first_name: @user.first_name, last_name: @user.last_name, login_name: @user.login_name } }
    end

    assert_redirected_to user_path(User.last)
  end

  [...]
end
----

At the beginning, we find a `setup` instruction:

[source,ruby]
----
setup do
  @user = users(:one)
end
----

These three lines of code mean that for the start of each individual
test, an instance `@user` with the data of the item `one` from the file
`test/fixtures/users.yml` is created. `setup` is a predefined callback
that - if present - is started by Rails before each test. The opposite
of setup is `teardown`. A `teardown` - if present - is called automatically
after each test.

NOTE: For every test (in other words, at each run of `rails test`), a
      fresh and therefore empty test database is created automatically. This
      is a different database than the one that you access by default via
      `rails console` (that is the development database). The databases are
      defined in the configuration file `config/database.yml`. If you want to
      do debugging, you can access the test database with
      `rails console test`.

This functional test then tests various web page functions. First,
accessing the index page:

[source,ruby]
----
test "should get index" do
  get users_url
  assert_response :success
end
----

The command `get users_url` accesses the page `/users`.
`assert_response :success` means that the page was delivered.

Let’s look more closely at the `should create user` problem from earlier.

[source,ruby]
----
test "should create user" do
  assert_difference('User.count') do
    post users_url, params: { user: { birthday: @user.birthday, first_name: @user.first_name, last_name: @user.last_name, login_name: @user.login_name } }
  end

  assert_redirected_to user_path(User.last)
end
----

The block `assert_difference('User.count') do ... end` expects a change
by the code contained within it. `User.count` after should result in +1.

The last line `assert_redirected_to user_path(User.last)` checks if
after the newly created record the redirection to the corresponding view
`show` occurs.

Without describing each individual functional test line by line, it's
becoming clear what these tests do: they execute real queries to the Web
interface (or actually to the controllers) and so they can be used for
testing the controllers.

[[unit-tests]]
=== Unit Tests

For testing the validations that we have entered in
`app/models/user.rb`, units tests are more suitable. Unlike the
functional tests, these test only the model, not the controller’s work.

The unit tests are located in the directory `test/models/`. But a look
into the file `test/models/user_test.rb` is rather sobering:

[source,ruby]
.test/models/user_test.rb
----
require 'test_helper'

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # test "the truth" do
  #   assert true
  # end
end
----

By default, scaffold only writes a commented-out dummy test.

A unit test always consists of the following structure:

[source,ruby]
----
test "an assertion" do
  assert something_is_true_or_false
end
----

The word `assert` already indicates that we are dealing with an
assertion in this context. If this assertion is `true`, the test will
complete and all is well. If this assertion is `false`, the test fails
and we have an error in the program (you can specify the output of the
error as string at the end of the assert line).

If you have a look at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html[guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html]
you'll see that there are some other `assert` variations. Here
are a few examples:

* `assert( boolean, [msg] )`
* `assert_equal( obj1, obj2, [msg] )`
* `assert_not_equal( obj1, obj2, [msg] )`
* `assert_same( obj1, obj2, [msg] )`
* `assert_not_same( obj1, obj2, [msg] )`
* `assert_nil( obj, [msg] )`
* `assert_not_nil( obj, [msg] )`
* `assert_match( regexp, string , [msg] )`
* `assert_no_match( regexp, string , [msg] )`

Let’s breathe some life into the first test in the
`test/unit/user_test.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.test/unit/user_test.rb
----
require 'test_helper'

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test 'a user with no attributes is not valid' do
    user = User.new
    assert_not user.save, 'Saved a user with no attributes.'
  end
end
----

This test checks if a newly created User that does not contain any data
is valid (it shouldn't be).

So a `rails test` then completes immediately:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test:units**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48169
Run options: --seed 43319

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.043224s, 23.1353 runs/s, 23.1353 assertions/s.

8 runs, 13 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

Now we integrate two asserts in a test to check if the two fixture
entries in the `test/fixtures/users.yml` are really valid:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'test_helper'

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test 'an empty user is not valid' do
    assert !User.new.valid?, 'Saved an empty user.'
  end

  test "the two fixture users are valid" do
    assert User.new(last_name: users(:one).last_name, login_name:
    users(:one).login_name ).valid?, 'First fixture is not valid.'
    assert User.new(last_name: users(:two).last_name, login_name:
    users(:two).login_name ).valid?, 'Second fixture is not valid.'
  end
end
----

Then once more a `rails test`:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test:units**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48169
Run options: --seed 11674

# Running:

.........

Finished in 0.388814s, 23.1473 runs/s, 38.5789 assertions/s.

9 runs, 15 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

[[fixtures]]
== Fixtures

With _fixtures_ you can generate example data for tests. The default
format for this is YAML. The files for this can be found in the
directory `test/fixtures/` and are automatically created with
`rails generate scaffold`. But of course you can also define your own
files. All fixtures are loaded anew into the test database by default
with every test.

Examples for alternative formats (e.g. CSV) can be found at
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Fixtures.html[api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Fixtures.html].

[[static-fixtures]]
=== Static Fixtures

The simplest variant for fixtures is static data. The fixture for `User`
used in xref:example-for-a-user-in-a-web-shop["Example for a
User in a Web Shop"] statically looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/users.yml
----
one:
  login_name: fox.mulder
  last_name: Mulder

two:
  login_name: dana.scully
  last_name: Scully
----

You simple write the data in YAML format into the corresponding file.

[[fixtures-with-erb]]
=== Fixtures with ERB

Static YAML fixtures are sometimes too unintelligent. In these cases,
you can work with ERB.

If we want to dynamically enter today’s day 20 years ago for the
birthdays, then we can simply do it with ERB in
`test/fixtures/users.yml`

[source,yaml]
.test/fixtures/users.yml
----
one:
  login_name: fox.mulder
  last_name: Mulder
  birthday: <%= 20.years.ago.to_s(:db) %>

two:
  login_name: dana.scully
  last_name: Scully
  birthday: <%= 20.years.ago.to_s(:db) %>
----

[[integration-tests]]
== Integration Tests

Integration tests are tests that work like functional tests but can go
over several controllers and additionally analyze the content of a
generated view. So you can use them to recreate complex workflows within
the Rails application. As an example, we will write an integration test
that tries to create a new user via the Web GUI, but omits the
`login_name` and consequently gets corresponding flash error messages.

A `rake generate scaffold` generates unit and functional tests, but not
integration tests. You can either do this manually in the directory
`test/integration/` or more comfortably with
`rails generate integration_test`. So let’s create an integration test:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails generate integration_test invalid_new_user_workflow**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48532
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/integration/invalid_new_user_workflow_test.rb
----

We now populate this file
`test/integration/invalid_new_user_workflow_test.rb` with the following
test:

[source,ruby]
.test/integration/invalid_new_user_workflow_test.rb
----
require 'test_helper'

class InvalidNewUserWorkflowTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  fixtures :all

  test 'try to create a new user without a login' do
    @user = users(:one)

    get '/users/new'
    assert_response :success

    post users_url, params: { user: { last_name: @user.last_name } }
    assert_equal '/users', path
    assert_select 'li', "Login name can't be blank"
    assert_select 'li', "Login name is too short (minimum is 10 characters)"
  end
end
----

Let’s run all tests:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails test**
Running via Spring preloader in process 48169
Run options: --seed 47618

# Running:

..........

Finished in 0.278271s, 3.5936 runs/s, 14.3745 assertions/s.

10 runs, 19 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
----

The example clearly shows that you can program much without manually
using a web browser to try it out. Once you have written a test for the
corresponding workflow, you can rely in future on the fact that it will
run through and you don’t have to try it out manually in the browser as
well.

[[rake-stats]]
== rails stats

rails stats With `rails stats` you get an overview of your Rails project.
For our example, it looks like this:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ **rails stats**

+----------------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+-----+-------+
  Code LOC: 73     Test LOC: 64     Code to Test Ratio: 1:0.9
----

In this project, we have a total of 73 LOC (Lines Of Code) in the
controllers, helpers and models. Plus we have a total of 64 LOC for
tests. This gives us a test relation of 1:1.0.9. Logically, this does
not say anything about the quality of tests.

[[more-on-testing]]
== More on Testing

The most important link on the topic testing is surely the URL
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html. There you will also find
several good examples on this topic.

No other topic is the subject of much discussion in the Rails community
as the topic testing. There are very many alternative test tools. One
very popular one is RSpec (see http://rspec.info/). I am deliberately
not going to discuss these alternatives here, because this book is
mainly about helping you understand Rails, not the thousands of extra
tools with which you can build your personal Rails development
environment.
